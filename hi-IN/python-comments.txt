Neptune

The smallest and fastest planet.

The hottest planet in the solar system. Water would turn to steam and some metals would melt just by being there!

You are here — the only planet we know of that can support life.

Home of Olympus Mons — the highest mountain in the Solar System.

The largest planet in the Solar System but with the shortest day — a little under ten hours.

Saturn's rings are wide enough to fit almost 10 Earths side-by-side. But they're only around 10 metres high!

The coldest planet in the Solar System and the first discovered after the telescope was invented.

The farthest planet from the Sun. Neptune's day is only 16 hours — but its year is 165 Earth years!
