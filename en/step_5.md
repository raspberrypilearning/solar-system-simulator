## Draw the planets

--- task ---

Go to your `draw_planets()` function. Below the code that draws Mercury, add `make_planet()` calls with the values for Venus and Earth. 

**Tip:** You copy pasted code, then made small changes, to create your dictionaries faster. You can do the same here, to make your planets with less typing.
