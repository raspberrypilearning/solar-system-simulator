You made a lot of dictionaries in your project. Which of these is the right way to create a dictionary about a person?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 
```python
person = ['age', 12, 'hair', 'brown']
```

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, this is a list. Lists are made with square brackets (`[]`).

- ( ) 
```python
person = {
  'age' = 12,
  'hair' = 'brown'
}
```

  --- feedback ---

  Close! But, when making a dictionary, keys and their values aren't separated by `=`.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 
```python
person = 
  'age': 12,
  'hair': 'brown'

```

  --- feedback ---

  Almost. Dictionaries need to begin and end with curly brackets `{` `}`.

- (x) 
```python
person = {
  'age': 12,
  'hair': 'brown'
}
```

  --- feedback ---

  Correct! Dictionaries are created with `{}`. Each key and value is separated with `:`, and pairs of `key: value` are separated by `,`. You can also make the dictionary with one line for each pair, to make it easier to read.
