You have a program with this code:

--- code ---
---
language: python
---

colours = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'pink', 'brown']

print(colour[2])

--- /code ---

If you run the program, which of these would you expect it to display?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 
```
red
green
blue
yellow
pink
brown
```
  --- feedback ---
  
  That's not quite right â€” a particular list element has been selected using `[]`.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) 
```
blue
```

  --- feedback ---

  That's correct! 'blue' is the list item which was selected for printing.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 
```
green
```

  --- feedback ---
  
  Not exactly. Although 'green' is the second item in the list, list indexes start at `0`.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 
```
blue
blue
```

  --- feedback ---
  
  Not quite. The `2` in the square brackets is the index of the item to be printed, not the number of times to print it.
