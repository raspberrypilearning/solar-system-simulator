Neptune

Home of Olympus Mons — the highest mountain in the Solar System.

The largest planet in the Solar System but with the shortest day — a little under ten hours.

Saturn's rings are wide enough to fit almost 10 Earths side-by-side. But they're only around 10 metres high!

The coldest planet in the Solar System and the first discovered after the telescope was invented.

The farthest planet from the Sun. Neptune's day is only 16 hours — but its year is 165 Earth years!
