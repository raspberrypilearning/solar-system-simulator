## Introduction

Get introduced to Python dictionaries by creating a model of the Solar System.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**The limits of models:**</span> Even very advanced models leave out details, to make them easier to build and run. This model keeps the order of the planets' speeds and sizes. But, for example, Mercury needs to be slow enough to click. So the model makes Mercury faster than the other planets, but not as fast as it really is.
</p>

You will:
 - Use **dictionaries** to store and lookup data
 - Load data from a file into **dictionaries**
 - Create an animated, interactive, Solar System model using the `p5` library

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Run the program to create the model. Try clicking on each planet to see facts about them.
